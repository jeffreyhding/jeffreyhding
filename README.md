## Hello ðŸ‘‹ My name is Jeffrey Ding

I'm an undergraduate student at UC Berkeley studying Statistics and Economics. I have a passion for data analysis/visualization and using my skills for social good. I'm currently working with Prof. Anastassia Fedyk (UC Berkeley) and James Hodson (AI for Good Foundation) to comprehensively valuate foreign aid to Ukraine (https://econ4ua.org/aid-value/).
